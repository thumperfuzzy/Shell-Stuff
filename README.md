# Shell-Stuff
Rewriting some linux shell commands in C.

These are not perfect, nor are they necessairly secure.

This project is mostly a reason for me to program something, fun to program, and helps me learn more about programming in c.    
It also helps me learn more about how linux shell commands work.
